    <h2 class="proj">About Me</h2>

    <div class="about">
        I am a senior studying computer science, looking to complete my B.Tech degree.
        I am mainly interested in the magic that happens underneath any complex system.
        I love backend engineering and systems engineering. I try to create everyday things to better understand them.
        I firmly believe Feynman's words - "What I cannot create, I do not understand".
        Few years back, I used to think Git was magic. But ever since I created my own version
        control system in python, I have been at peace. Currently I am implementing Redis and a KV pair basic database.

    <div class="about">
        I am also a part time photographer and drummer. I have been around music since my childhood.
        I started learning tabla when I was 4 and I have passed the 7th year (equivalent to a Ph.D lol) from Bangiya
        Sangeet Parishad in tabla.
        But since 9th grade, I have mostly played drums in my school band and later in my college as well.
        I am a huge fan of FC Barcelona and of football in general. I also watch Formula One in my free time, mostly
        supporting Ferrari and Red Bull.
        I essentially want to become a polymath as my interest lie over a variety of domains and fields.
