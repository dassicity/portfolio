    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I am a senior studying computer science, looking to complete my B.Tech degree.
        I am mainly interested in the magic that happens underneath any complex system.
        I love backend engineering and systems engineering. I try to create everyday things to better understand them.
        I firmly believe Feynman's words - "What I cannot create, I do not understand".
        Few years back, I used to think Git was magic. But ever since I created my own version
        control system in python, I have been at peace. Currently I am implementing Redis and a KV pair basic database.
